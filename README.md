# Quizz ALJP

This repository hosts an application that will enable you to create entertaining
real-time quizz. It's primary focus is to create a platform easy to understand
and that lets a group of people to play in the same room.


----
## Philosophy

Our aim is to create a great codebase that we're proud of. It includes tests,
full documentation, highly decoupled code, ... However, the first focus is to
get things done. Thus, some elements might look odd, but the overall quality
should increase over time.

----
## Usage

We've got rid of complex build tools and only focus on the cli. Thus, everything
that can be done in our project can be done with npm.

### Install all the dependencies
```
npm install
```

### Launch the server
```
npm start
```

### Test the codebase
```
npm test
```
It's not settled yet, but the code that should be tested on the client is
actually hosted on a temporary server. We're looking for a way to enable this
testing in a headless browser.

### Enable the dev environnement
```
npm run dev
```
If you're willing to enable live-reloading, be sure to install [the LiveReload
extension](http://livereload.com/extensions/) on your browser
